# RepoTree 🌳

A web tool that visualizes GitHub and GitLab repositories with clean ASCII trees. Perfect for documentation, sharing, and understanding project structures. It runs entirely in the browser and fetches live data using GitHub’s official [REST API (Git/Trees API)](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/git/trees?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-tree) to ensure accuracy.

## 🤔 About

I created RepoTree to help developers easily visualize and share repository structures.

A year ago, I saw a Stack Overflow question about generating directory trees from GitHub repositories, which inspired me to build this tool.
